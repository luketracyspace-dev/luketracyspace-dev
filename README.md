# Luke Tracy  
### PhD Researcher | Space Medicine • Biomedical Sensing • Data & Embedded Systems

I’m a PhD researcher in aerospace / space medicine based out of New Zealand

My work focuses on understanding cellular and physiological adaptation to microgravity and partial-gravity environments, using:

- Novel Random Positioning Machines 
- Sensor-driven monitoring systems

## Current Focus

  -  **Biological data analysis**
  - RNA-seq / omics pipelines (GeneLab-style datasets)
  - Statistical analysis & visualization (Python, R)

  -  **Embedded & sensing systems**
  - IMU-based gravity vector analysis
  - Physiological monitoring (PPG, bioimpedance, temperature)
  - Real-time cell monitoring in microgravity conditions (both real and simulated)
  - ESP32 / microcontroller-based data logging

  -  **Microgravity & partial-gravity simulation**
  - Random Positioning Machines 
  - Validation of effective gravity vectors
  - Algorithm development for partial-g simulation
